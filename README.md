# AIDI2004-1_Lab2 - WDBC Machine Learning Models
Repository for Lab 2 of AI in Enterprise Systems

This repository contains a model that can be used to predict if a growth is benign or malignant (breast cancer) given the right data.

To use the sklearn model, ensure that you have the appropriate libraries install. Namely, to properly use this model, have pandas, numpy, sklearn, and pickle installed. To load the model, simple use pickle.loads("andrewmarkdale_model_v1.pkl"). Once loaded, you can make predictions given you have the appropriate data. 

Model V1: This model is a Stacking Classifier model, with a fairly decent accuracy of 97.4%.
